!Sample gophermap (modified from Gophernicus)

##
## This is a sample gophermap.
##
#
Creating a file called "gophermap" into a directory disables the
normal resource listing and replaces it with the contents of the map
file.
# XXX not supported
# You can also have inline gophermaps - files with a ".gophermap"
# extension are parsed as gophermaps and displayed in between normal
# resources in alphabetical order.

In a gophermap any line that doesn't contain a <TAB> character is
automatically converted to an type "i" gopher resource which are
displayed as plain text in the client. Lines which contain tabs are
intepreted as gopher resource lines which the client will render as
links. The first line of a gophermap should be a !Title line
describing the menu.
#
# XXX not supported
# Dynamic gophermaps are possible by making the gophermap a script and
# marking it as executable. All script output is parsed just like a
# static gophermap, for example lines without tabs are converted to "i"
# resources. Executable gophermaps are always ran through the default
# shell (/bin/sh) so depending on your operating system that's either
# slow, or really unbearably slow...

The format of a gophermap resource line is simple:
Xname<TAB>selector<TAB>host<TAB>port

Where:
   X          is the gopher filetype
   name       is an explanation of the resource
   selector   is the path to resource
   host:port  are the hostname and port number to go to

Type and name are mandatory. If you don't specify a selector, the
name field will be also used as the selector. If you don't specify
host or port the host:port of the current server are used instead.
Also make sure to use ONLY ONE TAB between the fields.

Valid filetypes include:
   0   text file
   1   directory
   3   error message
   5   archive file (zip, tar etc)
   7   search query
   8   telnet session
   9   binary file
   g   GIF image
   h   HTML file
   i   info text
   I   generic image file (other than GIF)
   d   document file (ps, pdf, doc etc)
   s   sound file
   ;   video file
   c   calendar file
   M   MIME file (mbox, emails etc)

Additional type characters supported:
   #          comment - rest of the line is ignored
   !title     menu title (use on the first line)
# XXX not supported yet
#   -file      hide file from listings
# XXX not supported yet
#   :ext=type  change filetype (for this directory only)
# XXX not supported
#   ~          include a list of users with valid ~/public_gopher
# XXX not supported
#   %          include a list of available virtual hosts
   =mapfile   include or execute other gophermap
   *          stop processing gophermap, include file listing
   .          stop processing gophermap (default)

Examples of valid resource lines:

# XXX https://github.com/gophernicus/gophernicus/blob/master/README.gophermap
# does not have a <TAB> in the following line (seems it was
# unintentionally removed in commit 326c15c):
1subdir	
1Relative internal link	subdir
1Absolute internal link	/subdir
1External link 	/	gopher.floodgap.com	70
#
# XXX external links should use the selector as-is
1External link without leading slash	subdir/	gopher.domain.dom	70
1External link with blank selector 		gopher.floodgap.com	70
0Finger-to-gopher link	user	example.test	79
