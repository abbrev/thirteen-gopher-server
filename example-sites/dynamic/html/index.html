<h1>Test HTML index file</h1>

<p>This is a test HTML index file.</p>

<p>Yep, this file really is an HTML file called index.html, and if it's referenced indirectly as a directory index file it can be served as plain text to a Gopher client by running it through Lynx.</p>

<p>This is more of a proof of concept than to serve any practical purpose.
It would also be nice for HTML links to be converted to Gopher menu entries, but that's currently not supported.</p>

<p><em>Emphasized.</em> <i>Italic.</i> <b>Bold.</b> <u>Underline.</u></p>
<p>This<br/>paragraph<br/>has<br/>hard<br/>breaks.</p>
